                <h2> Project Intent </h2>
                <p> Wanted to work with a team to make a game in a single weekend. Made 
                    in pygame since it was the only coding software we were familiar with. Made schedules 
                    for each other and worked arund that. The goal of the game was escaping a 2D platforming mansion where 
                    exiting rooms in the wrong order randomized the layout and reset your progress. This was my first group coding project.</p>

                <p> First time working on a team, with other people's contributions and schedules. 
                    (I was still the only programmer). Worked on adding other's ideas into gameplay.</p>

                <p> I was able to make a simple game w/ contributions from others. 
                    We worked well as a team and achieved our goals in the short timeframe.</p>
