                <h2> Project Intent </h2>
                <p> "Isles of Aether" is the 2023-2024 Shawnee State Senior capstone project.</p>

                <h2> Project Achievements </h2>
                <p> 
In my portfolio, I'm excited to showcase my role in the development of "Isles of Aether," where I specialized in procedural generation. Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the team to integrate procedural generation algorithms, ensuring the creation of dynamic and immersive landscapes. This process required constant communication and coordination with artists, designers, and fellow programmers to achieve a seamless integration of procedural and handcrafted elements. By leveraging my technical expertise in procedural generation and working collaboratively within the team, we were able to deliver a game that not only showcases individual skills but also demonstrates the power of effective teamwork in achieving a common vision. "Isles of Aether" stands as a testament to our collective effort and the successful fusion of creativity and technical proficiency. </p>

                <h2> Project Take-Away </h2>
                <p> In a few days, I was able to pick up a new engine and make a product I was happy with. I might return to it in the future,
                    because of the time frame, I was not able to completely flesh out some of the more 'extra' content I originally wanted
                     to but didn't meet the scope of the project. </p>
